    "postContents": "Kingdom Hearts is a game quite dear to my heart, so there will be a lot of bias in this Review. This will not be a look at the whole series, but instead a look into the first game, however there will be mention of spoilers for the whole series, so be warned if you want to read this.\\n\\nThe first Kingdom Hearts is a Clunky game, theres no doubt about it. Nowadays most people will be playing the Final Mix version, for PS3, PS4, Xbox One, and PC, however when I first played it as a kid, I played the original PS2 release. In this original release, there was no camera control with the right stick, as the right stick was mapped to menu navigation. Even as a kid, I never used this feature, and exclusively used the D-Pad to move through the menu. As a random fun fact, In the original, R3 (which is pressing in on the Right stick) was an alternative way to select stuff in the menu, which meant that you could play the entire game without hitting the X button, as they both shared functionality. I loved the original Kingdom Hearts, and sometimes return to it, just to see the exclusive glitches and orignial models for Sora and Ansem, who both had to be remade using the Assets from Kingdom Hearts DDD, as they lost both of their models in the PS3 port, which all future releases were based on.\\n\\n<images/KingdomHearts_Collection.jpg>\\nPictured above my personal Collection. At the time of taking this photo I only had KH3 on digital, now have a physical copy. Note my prized possesion, Japanese versions of Kingdom Hearts Final Mix, and Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix Plus\\n\\nAnyways, to the game itself. The game follows Sora, Riku, and Kairi, a Trio of Young kids, 14, 15, and 14 respectively (according to the original PS2 Manual) and their adventure through various Disney Properties. Sora is the \"chosen wielder of the Keyblade\"  A magical Sword/Key that has the power to open and close locks. These three are amazing main characters, but one is kinda lesser than the other. Kairi is a great character in this game, but is absent for almost all of it. The Series has plenty of games, and you would think she would get her time to shine in later games, but unfortunately that is only kinda true. Unfortunatly the series insists on treating her like shes useless, and no game other than this one really has a Kairi that is a good character, and in this game she's literally gone for 80% of it. Sora is an amazing protaganist, as he's not really his later incarnation (which I love). He doesn't trust people as easy as later in the series, and he has his own voice and his own motives, which difer from his allies. Riku is a weird character I will talk about later, but he is a great antagonist for this game.\\n\\nThe Plot revolves around the Heartless, who are animalistic entites that want to steal hearts. Every world (AKA different levels, almost all based on Disney Properties) has a Heart, which if the heartless get to, will destroy that world. Unfortunetly, this happens to Destiny Islands, the world that Sora, Riku, and Kairi hail from. Their world is destroyed, and they are all sent their seperate ways\\n\\n<https://kh.wiki.gallery/images/thumb/d/de/Shadow_KHII.png/300px-Shadow_KHII.png>\\nHeartless are Cute little Buggers\\n\\n While Kairi goes missing from the worlds destruction, and Sora and Riku both find different groups of Disney characters to work with on their quest to find Kairi. Sora teams up with Donald and Goofy, who are both looking for Mickey Mouse, who has gone missing, and Riku works with Maleficent, from Sleeping Beauty, and other various Disney Villains. The two characters meet up at various points throughout the story, getting more and more hostile towards each other, until Sora arrives at Neverland, where Riku makes it clear that he has both found Kairi, and also intends to Kill Sora. When Sora finally arrives at Hollow Bastion, the base of Malifecent and Riku, Riku reveals that he was always the original wielder of the Keyblade, and steals it back from him.\\n\\nSomething that has been talked a lot about this series is that Keyblades are eventually given out like candy. It stops being an interesting and unique thing about Sora, and instead becomes something that everyone has access to. This doesn't bother me as much as it does some other people, and here's why. Sora losing his Keyblade is a massive blow to his ego, but, as he says later, his power doesn't come from the Keyblade, it comes from his Friends. This realization lets Sora regain his Keyblade, but shows that the Keyblade doesn't really matter that much. This is reinforced by another Keyblade showing up by the end of this Level, as well as Mickey showing up with his own Keyblade. The Keyblade wasn't as much of an important object, as much as it is a tool for Sora's Heart, which is the real weapon, As the voice (who after so many games I'm still not sure who it is, Mickey? Chirity? Tetsuya Nomora?) \"You[Sora] hold the mightiest weapon of all\". This is before he gets the Keyblade, and it wasn't his in the first place, as revealed by Riku later on, so this must be referring to Sora's Heart.\\n\\n<https://kh.wiki.gallery/images/thumb/f/f6/Kingdom_Key_KHIII.png/200px-Kingdom_Key_KHIII.png>\\nLots of Keyblades in this series\\n\\nAnyways, Riku makes a deal with Ansem, a shady guy in a cloak, and is possessed by Ansem. Maleficent is Killed by Sora, and The two Friends fight to the death. Sora reigns victorious, but not before Riku-Ansem reveals that he has Kairi's heart in him, and the only way for him to revive her is to be stabbed with the keyblade that Riku-Ansem has. In one final selfless act, Sora stabs himself, and revives Kairi, but at expense of his own life. He is turned into a Heartless, but is quickly brought back by Kairi, and goes to fight Ansem, who is attempting to open \"Kingdom Hearts\", but is thwarted by Sora, who reveals that \"Kingdom Hearts is Light\". Unfortunetly, Kingdom Hearts also acts as a doorway to the Realm of Darkness (Its weird and complicated) and they have to close it. But someone has to lock it from the other side, and so Mickey is on the other side, with a newly reformed Riku (who will spend the rest of the series atoning for this game) And together they all close the Door. The worlds that were being destroyed are brought back, and the story concludes with the main Trio, that being Sora, Donald, and Goofy on a pathway, that will lead to the next game in the series, Chain of Memories for the GBA.\\n\\nIn that story synopsis, I skipped over quite a lot, foremost umong them, being the Disney characters themselves. Donald is actually one of my favorite characters in this first game, as for the first part of the game, he is constantly arguing with Sora. Both want to be in charge, and they fight over their differing goals. Donald is mostly just using Sora, while Sora is pretty much just Using Donald and Goofy. But throught the game, they find themselves to be friends, and eventually learn to respect each other. This means that for the rest of the series, you completely believe their friendship is genuine, because of the strife they go through in this game, and the following one.\\n\\nThe Other Disney stuff is also at its best in this game. Instead of adapting the plot of the movie into video game form, they take the characters and scenarios of the original movie and make their own stories. Worlds like Monstro and Neverland practically are just Kingdom Hearts original worlds, as they focus on Sora and Riku instead of the Disney characters, who are mostly a backdrop. Other worlds like Halloween town are able to do full plots featuring the Heartless and other Kingdom Hearts original concepts as their primary plot pushers. Haloween town doesn't even go to Christmas town, which is the location of half the original movie, **The Nightmare Before Christmas**. Overall this game is the only one where the Disney worlds feel like just as important as the non-disney worlds. It helps a lot that the enemy team consists of Disney Villans, so you are literally on enemy bases for most of the second half of the game. When you arrive at Agrabah, and Jafar and Maleficent are walking down the Bazzar, talking about Keyholes and Princesses of Heart, you feel intimidated. I always interpreted Jafar as the right hand man to Maleficent, so taking him down is a massive achievement.\\n\\nThe Kingdom Hearts original content is also spectacular, Ansem, while only around for the end of the game, is a great villan. He shows up early on in the game, and makes a big impact by scaring the shit out of 6 year old me, and by the end of the game, is having philosophical debates with Sora. Unfortunetly the dialog, while having interesting meanings, comes down to \"Darkness is Good\" \"No its not, Light is good\" \"Hahaha Darkness is actually good, you are a stupid kid\" Which kinda dampens the impact.\\n\\n<https://kh.wiki.gallery/images/thumb/1/14/Ansem%2C_Seeker_of_Darkness_%28with_Dark_Figure%29_KH.png/350px-Ansem%2C_Seeker_of_Darkness_%28with_Dark_Figure%29_KH.png>\\nScary Dude\\n\\nOverall this game is really good, and I didn't even get into the gameplay (maybe a later post) But this post is mostly a test post for long posts in this website. Its something I can ramble about for literal hours, and I will, but I wrote this all during my lunch break, so forgive me for any gramatical or technical mistakes. \\<3\\n\\nAll pictures (other than first one) from KH-wiki, and used legally through their Creative Commons (CC) License."

    "postContents": "Okay, so I didn't really grow up on this game or anything, I was always a playstation kid, so I didn't play this until a couple years ago, but straight up, I've played way worse. I tried playing it a couple years back, but I played it on my Wii Virtual Console, and the controls were super slippery, which is a well known issue with the wii n64 emulator, so I decided to pick up the real game when I came into possesion of an actual N64. Nope. Its just as slippery as it was on the wii, just now with a weird 3 handed controller.\\n\\nAnyways, the game itself is really good, in the first few levels. But doing any sort of precision platforming is so god awful, mainly because for some reason Mario turns weirdly. From what I can tell, he either snaps in the direction of your stick, or he loops around in a circle, and I cannot for the life of me figure out what decides what one to do. Thats probably my number 1 complaint about the game.\\n\\nBest level is by far, the first few, just that whole first floor is spectactacular. Worst is by far Rainbow ride, specifically the 100 coin star, which was my last star. As a sidenote, I still don't know if I know how the snowmans head rolls."

    "postContents": "This Book was quite boring for most of it. Beowulf isn't a particularly interesting protagonist, and the antagonists weren't too interesting. The version I read back in high school was written in Old English, which was probably the most interesting thing about the book, as it showed the evolution of language. No one is actually gonna read a review of Beowulf, so I'm just gonna start Tangenting about stuff. Theres a big part of me that actually wants to get a minor in Linguistics because of the coolness of the evolution of language. I took Latin back in high school, and actually ended up at pretty much the top of my class, and learned quite a lot. Although useless to speak, Latin is a really cool language in a historical context, as it is the root language for many languages, and although English is not a Romantic Language (it is instead Germanic, all you have to do is read Beowulf to discover that, its practically in German) Its still quite interesting to see many of the influences of latin in the english language, many of which can be attributed to the Church\\n\\n There are three major parts to this story. The first is A battle against Grendel. Grendel is a decendant of Cain, and thus is an Ogre like creature. This is probably the most boring fight, as it is a bit of a Curbstomp in favor of Beowulf. He literraly tears this man apart with his arms. Ouch.\\n\\nThe Second battle is against Grendels Mother. Something interesting about this story is the existence of a named weapon, Hrunting, which is the sword he uses to slay the Mother. Its cool seeing something that would be a common mainstay in media in the 21st century so long ago, the idea of a powerful, legendary, named sword. I believe Excalaber came before Beowulf, however its still cool. I really don't have much to say tbh.\\n\\nThe Final battle is against the Dragon. As an advid DnD fan, I love dragons, and so should you. Unfortunetly the dragon and beowulf kill each other. Wiglaf witnesses his death, but honestly neither character was interesting enough to care.\\n\\nI really don't know why when I was like \"I need to make a review of something to take up space on the page\" I decided on Beowulf? Like wtf dude, I read this in high school, its more than half a decade at this point since I read it, and I didn't even like it??? Whatever I guess this is going on the page since I just spent 15 minutes writing this.\\n\\nImage Obtained from Wikimedia Commons"

Yeah I know a computer Science Student who likes Video Games, real original.\\n\\nAnyway's the game. Its Spiderman PS4, it really is spectacular, amazing, and other adjectives. If you haven't played it, you really should. The Webslinging is amazing and I love to just play this to swing around all day. The story is spectacular and made me cry like 3 times. The dodging system is so satisfying every single time. But in the end, Its just a spectacular game everyone should play."
